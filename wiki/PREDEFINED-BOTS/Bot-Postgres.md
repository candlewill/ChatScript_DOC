# Bot Postgres - Postgres Database bot

ChatScript comes with a bot used to prove postgres connection works.

To use it you have to edit the simpletopic code of the bot to put in a valid password, assuming you
named your db postgres, you use port 5432 and the user is postgres.

After that, it accepts commands `open`, `close`, `table`, `drop`, `store`, `list`. 

List will print out the contents of some data in the database.
